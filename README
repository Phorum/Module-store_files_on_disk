Module  : Store files on disk
Version : 1.1.1
Authors : Thomas Seifert

This module takes care of storing file data (attachments, personal user
files) on disk instead of using the database as the file storage.

This is an advanced module for users that have a problem with storing
files in the database. Don't just do this because you read on a blog
somewhere that putting files in a database is bad.

For running this mod, you need Phorum 5.2.0 or later. It will not
work for earlier versions of Phorum.


Installation:
-------------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "store_files_on_disk" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Go to the settings screen for the module. On the settings screen,
  configure the directory that you want to use for storing the Phorum
  files. The webserver must be allowed to write to this directory.

- After editing the settings, go back the the "Modules" section and
  enable the module "Store files on disk".


Converting files that are already stored in the database:
---------------------------------------------------------

This module contains an on-the-fly conversion mechanism, which will convert
files that are stored in the database to disk storage, right at the moment
that they are requested. This mechanism will gradually convert the available
files to the disk storage.

If you want to forcibly convert all available files to file storage,
then you can use the conversion script console_convert.php that you
can find in the module directory. This script's intended use it to
run it from the system command prompt, using the PHP interpreter. Example:

  $ php console_convert.php
