2010-04-23 1.1.1

    - Changed the file path generation code to use gmstrftime() instead
		  of strftime(). Because strftime() dependens on the server timezone,
			changing the server timezone resulted in changed file storage path
			and broken file downloads as result.

      Files will be automatically converted to the new storage path on
      access. It is possible to use the console_convert.php script
			(which is a command line script) to speed up this process.

			Note:
		  The automatic conversion from the 1.1.0 release will also
			be performed, so you can upgrade directly to this release when
			coming from a pre-1.1.0 version.

2009-07-10 1.1.0

    - Modified the path that is used for storing files on disk. Before this
      version, we used a deep hashing tree, based on the MD5 sum of the
      file_id. This provided perfect distribution of the files, however it
      has made several hosting providers crazy, because their backup systems
      could not cope with the file tree traversal.
      Additionally, some Phorum owners would like to purge old stored files
      once in a while. The hashing mechanism is not ideal for doing this,
      because old and new files will be intermixed in the directories.

      The old storage path looked like:
      /path/to/store/XXX/XXX/XXX/XXX/XXX/XXX/XXX/XXX/XXX/XXX/<file_id>
      (where the X-es are determined by the file_id's MD5 sum)

      The new storage path looks like:
      /path/to/store/YYYY/MMDD/HH/<file_id>

      Files will be automatically converted to the new storage path on
      access. It is possible to use the console_convert.php script
      (which is a command line script) to speed up this process.

      Note that this change required some changes in the Phorum core
      as well. This means that Phorum needs to be upgraded to at least
      version 5.2.12 to be able to use version 1.1.0 of this module.

      on storage problems.
